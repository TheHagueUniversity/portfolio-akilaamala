      <h3 id="one">Liefe gaat door de Maag</h3>
      <p>For our Bespoke Design class, we were given a project to create a digital gifting and unwrapping experience for Hallmark. My partner and I created a customizable food box called 'Liefe gaat door de Maag'. When someone receives it, they will receive unlabeled ingredients and the challenge is: they have to cook an unknown dish using unknown ingredients, with the Hallmark website as a guide! Our project was chosen as the best. See the unwrapping prototype I created here.</p>

      <h3 id="two">Duckbrows</h3>
      <p>My first experience with visual world is through drawing. Since I was little, I got influenced by cartoons and I tried to recreate it myself. Those doodles I did transformed into a real passion, even until now. When I turned 16, I found a way to explore my interest and showcase it to the world by creating @duckbrows on Instagram. My main inspirations for my artwork are cartoon, haute couture, and my own experiences. See more of my artworks here.</p>

      <h3 id="three">Processing</h3>
      <p>For our Programming class, we are required to create an interactive artwork with Processing. I got an idea of a program that enables a user to create an interactive artwork. I played with a black bachground and three colors, and the user can create an 'artwork' from three colors. But here's the twist: you can only use the colors in limited amount of time, so you have to race against time. Experience it yourself here.</p>

      <p>I take commissions from time to time, whether it is for digital artwork or graphic design. One of my projects is I was hired by Opinionion, a Jakarta-based startup company. See more here.</p>
